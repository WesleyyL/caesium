# Cesium

Cesium a public database containing approximately 1800 3-species, 450 6-species, and 750 10-species oscillating networks created using a customized evolution algorithm, an optimization process based on the iterative improvement of candidate models. The source code for the algorithm that generated these evolved models can be found here: https://github.com/ltatka/oscillatorDB
